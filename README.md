  - Semester
  - College information

### Navigation

  - Home (Lost & Found items)
  - Notifications
    - In-app notifications screen implemented

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Mobile + Web)

  - Firestore Database
  - Storage (for images)
- **Theme**: Material Design with custom theme support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK
- Firebase account
- Android Studio/VS Code

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd unilink
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Configure Firebase (all platforms):
- Create a new Firebase project
- Add Android/iOS apps in Firebase console
- Download and add configuration files
  - `google-services.json` for Android
  - `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS
 - For Web, configuration is managed via `lib/firebase_options.dart` (generated by FlutterFire CLI). No manual script tags are needed in `web/index.html`.

4. Run the app (mobile):
```bash
flutter run
```

5. Run the app on Web:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```
Notes:
- Web support is enabled and the app boots via Flutter's web bootstrap. Firebase is initialized from Dart code.
- Authentication redirects work on web (router listens to auth state changes). If you ever see stale navigation, a hard refresh will also sync the state.
